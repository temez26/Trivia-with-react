## Features to add 🌟
- Instead of telling the user by text what is correct, it should indicate by color what was right and what was wrong.
  For example, if the user presses the wrong answer, then the button lights up red, and the correct answer lights up green. Done!
- Add particles background, at least for the mobile version.
- Add night and day mode to the layout.

### Bugs 🐞
- When pressing the check answer button before asking any question, the game gives points for correct answers. (Fixed)
